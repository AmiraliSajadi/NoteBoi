## About
NoteBoi is an Android note-taking application designed to help users create, organize, and store their notes online. Developed as one of my first programming projects, it demonstrates a combination of Android development skills and backend integration.

The app uses **Parse Server**, hosted on **Back4App**, for seamless account creation, note storage, and retrieval. A quick sign-up process lets users save their notes online (email confirmation optional).

## Features
- User Accounts: Quick sign-up process with optional email confirmation and recovery.
- Online Note Storage: Save and sync notes using a Parse Server backend.
- Clean UI: Minimalist design for an intuitive user experience.
- Interactive Gestures: Swipe notes to delete or favorite or pull to refresh.
